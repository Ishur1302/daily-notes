# 🚀 Daily Progress: Jan 26, 2026

Today was a massive push across three core pillars: Competitive Programming, Engineering Fundamentals, and Frontend Architecture.

---

## 🏆 Codeforces & Competitive Programming
- **Focus:** Problem Solving & Optimization.
- **Topics:** [e.g., Greedy Algorithms / Bit Manipulation]
- **Takeaway:** Practiced reducing time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n \log n)$ using sorting and binary search.

## ⚛️ React.js Development
- **Focus:** Component Lifecycle & State Management.
- **Key Concepts:**
    - **`useEffect` Cleanup:** Learned how to prevent memory leaks by cleaning up subscriptions/timers.
    - **Custom Hooks:** Abstracted logic into a reusable `useFetch` hook for my projects.
- **Project Work:** Refined the UI for my portfolio/e-commerce site.

## 🎓 GATE Prep (Core CS)
- **Subject:** Operating Systems / Discrete Math.
- **Topic:** [e.g., Paging & Segmentation / Graph Theory].
- **GATE Note:** Deep-dived into **Virtual Memory** and how the TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) speeds up address translation.
