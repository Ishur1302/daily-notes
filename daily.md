---

## 📅 Today's Progress: January 17, 2026

### 💡 DSA & Algorithms
- **Today's Topic:** [e.g., Dynamic Programming / Sliding Window]
- **Problem Solved:** [e.g., LeetCode #70 Climbing Stairs]
- **Key Logic:** Used Memoization to reduce time complexity from O(2^n) to O(n).

### 🖥️ Core CS (TCS Prep)
- **Operating Systems (OS):** Reviewed **CPU Scheduling Algorithms** (Round Robin, FCFS).
- **Computer Networks (CN):** Studied the **OSI Model** layers and TCP vs UDP.
- **OOPs:** Practiced **Polymorphism** and **Abstraction** in Java/C++.

### 🌐 Full-Stack Development
- **JavaScript:** Deep dive into **Closures** and **Event Loop**.
- **React:** Implemented **`useMemo`** to optimize re-renders in a project.
