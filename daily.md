# 📚 Tech Interview Prep Log | 2026
**Focus:** DSA, TCS NQT/Digital Prep, Core CS (OS, CN, OOPs) & Full-Stack (JS, React)

---

## 📅 Today's Progress: January 17, 2026

### 💡 DSA & Algorithms
- **Today's Topic:** [e.g., Dynamic Programming / Sliding Window]
- **Problem Solved:** [e.g., LeetCode #70 Climbing Stairs]
- **Key Logic:** Used Memoization to reduce time complexity from O(2^n) to O(n).

### 🖥️ Core CS (TCS Prep)
- **Operating Systems (OS):** Reviewed **CPU Scheduling Algorithms** (Round Robin, FCFS).
- **Computer Networks (CN):** Studied the **OSI Model** layers and TCP vs UDP.
- **OOPs:** Practiced **Polymorphism** and **Abstraction** in Java/C++.

### 🌐 Full-Stack Development
- **JavaScript:** Deep dive into **Closures** and **Event Loop**.
- **React:** Implemented **`useMemo`** to optimize re-renders in a project.

## 📅 Jan 19, 2026: Computer Networks (CN) Deep Dive

Today I focused on the fundamentals of how data moves across the web. This is essential for understanding Full-Stack performance and backend communication.

### 🌐 The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)
I reviewed the 7 layers that standardize network functions:
1. **Physical:** Transmission of raw bits over cables/fiber.
2. **Data Link:** MAC addressing and error detection (Frames).
3. **Network:** IP addressing and Routing (Packets).
4. **Transport:** End-to-end communication (TCP/UDP).
5. **Session:** Managing sessions between applications.
6. **Presentation:** Data encryption and formatting (SSL/TLS).
7. **Application:** Human-computer interaction (HTTP, FTP, SMTP).



### ⚡ Key Concepts Learned
- **TCP vs UDP:** TCP is connection-oriented (reliable), while UDP is connectionless (fast).
- **The 3-Way Handshake:** How TCP establishes a connection (SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK).
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** The "Phonebook of the Internet" that translates URLs to IP addresses.

### 🎯 Interview Prep Goal
Matching my **365-day LeetCode streak** with strong theoretical knowledge in CN to be fully prepared for the TCS Digital/Prime technical rounds.

# 🚀 Daily Progress: Jan 27, 2026

### 🏆 Competitive Programming (Codeforces)
- **Rating Range:** 1000 - 1100
